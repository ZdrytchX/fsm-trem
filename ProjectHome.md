A tremulous project to improve, and create clients, and servers for the community to use at free will. This project was first started as a joint effort between Frak, Slacker, and Mercury to provide the community with high quality client and server builds.

Tremulous SVN revision this project is based on: _SVN 1101_

# **Getting started** #

When you first get the client, place it in the following locations.
  * Windows
    * _C:\Program Files\Tremulous and overwrite the current client._

  * Linux
    * _This location can vary, but most often is placed in /usr/local/games/tremulous._

  * OS X
    * _/Applications/tremulous-20060625 folder, assuming you downloaded the client from Apple Downloads._

After doing so, you may find some things different that you don't like, but don't know how to change them. If you have _any_ problems, please check out the [F.A.Q. Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/fsm-trem/wiki/FAQ), if you cannot find an answer to your question there, please contact a project member about your issue.

# **Community consideration** #

We will accept any code or ideas that you give us, as long as it agrees with the following rules.

  * _The code or idea has to be within the limitations of our programming ability._

  * _The code or idea has to have a definite use, we will not accept silly functions that print "hi im shooting you" into the client._

  * _The code or idea cannot be a function to give a player an advantage over others in game, a.k.a. cheats. If the function has the possibility of being a cheat, then its use has to outweigh its cheating capability._

If your code or idea agrees with the following, feel free to post an issue of your code of idea. We will most likely add it.

# **Why?** #

When I first tried the game _Tremulous_ I was pointed to the original [TJW backport](http://trem.tjw.org/backport), I noticed some lacking features that I sometimes required. From there, I looked into how to compile a _Tremulous_ client, and from then on I had added my own code and patches. I then wanted to start a client that gives the community the same options I had, for the ones that either don't have the skill or time to make their own clients. That is why Frak, Slacker, and me have all agreed to include any code or ideas that can pass the above rules. - **Mercury**

I have been doing my own client for a while with tw-clientserver
and just wanted a project with VOIP so i didn't have to type that much :) - **Slacker**

I'm a feature-friendly person. Anything I create has to be as user friendly as possible, though in this case, its community friendly. Though the TJW client was great, I was excited of an idea that would actively include new bells and whistles. While Slack and Mercury do the under-the-hood work, I sit in the cab, waxing and polishing the inside, waiting to start the engine and sell the car. - **Frak**

# **Updating and version identification** #

Current codename: **No Release Yet**

To check if your client is out dated, follow these steps...

  * _Open your client and press the ~ key(beside the 1, and above the TAB key) to open the console._
  * _Look towards the lower right hand corner of your console, look at the word in parenthesis._
  * _Compare the word with the one above, if they do not match, please update your client._

After updating, your clients codename should match the one above. If not, please notify a project member.
